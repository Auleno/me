    <h1> Hobbies</h1>
    <p>In my free time now, I spend a lot of it playing video games with friends. Between competetive and more cooperative ones.</p>
      <ol><u>Games I play</u>
        <li>League of Legends</li>
        <li>Age of Empires</li>
        <li>Genshin Impact</li>
        <li>Mabinogi</li>
        <li>Dishonored</li>
        <li>Chess</li>
      </ol>

    <p>Many of which I play according to my mood. Aside from games I also tend to search for art. A friend gifted a piece to me.</p>

    <p> So I would look for art online and leisurely listen to music. Sometimes while doing other work.</p>
