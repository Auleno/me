    <h1>About me</h1>
    <img src="images/flushing.jpg" alt="Flushing,Queens" style="width:653px;height:367px">
      <p> I live in Flushing, Queens. It's a pretty Asian neighborhood with some other ethnic population within. </p>
      <p>I've only travelled within the New York and some close adjacencies like New Jersey. </p>
      <p>My last few years in New York has had me exploring the city for interesting places to see in the city. Across various parts of Manhattan to Queens.</p>
      <ul>
        <u>Places I've been</u>
          <li>Niagara Falls</li>
          <li>Japan</li>
      </ul>

      <p>During highschool, I had an opportunity to travel to Japan for a week. However, I'd like to visit again as I couldn't quite appreciate much of the experience when I was younger.</p>
