    <h1> Media and Politics</h1>
    <p>I've studied how politics are shaped by the media outlets that many people are exposed to. Perception of the president is highly influenced by the political parties that control the media companies of the country.</p>
    <p> All of our news media outlets are politicized one way or another. It's just different degrees of influence and concerning which figure.
      <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="flex-item1 blue"><img class="news" src="images/ABCicon.png">Democratic Blue leaning</div>
        <div class="flex-item2 red"><img class="news" src="images/Foxicon.png">Republican Red leaning</div>
        <div class="flex-item3 blue"><img class="news" src="images/CBSicon.png"style="width:150px;">Democratic Blue leaning</div>
        <div class="flex-item4 blue"><img class="news" src="images/NYTicon.jpg" style="width:200px;">Democratic Blue leaning</div>
        <div class="flex-item5 red"><img class="news" src="images/DWicon.png">Republican Red leaning</div>
      </div>

    <p>You would be surprised to know that sometimes the same party criticizes their party the most. It may have been an outlier with President Trump during his time as Executive Commander, but there was his share of Republican critics. Yet, President Obama's presence in the White House was widely supported by his party and opposed by the opposition.</p>
